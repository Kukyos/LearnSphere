## 1. What Exists Right Now (Initial Commit State)

### Current Stack
| Layer | Tech | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|

## 2. Constraints & Limitations

### Hard Constraints (Hackathon Rules)
- **Time:** ~23 hours total
- **Team:** 4 people (A, D, S, J)  
- **Must deliver:** Working demo with both Instructor/Admin backoffice AND Learner website
- **Must cover:** Course CRUD, Lessons, Quizzes, Progress tracking, Points/Badges, Ratings, Reporting

### Technical Constraints
- **No real backend yet.** Everything is mock data in `constants.ts`. D needs to set up backend.
- **No routing.** Currently a single-page app. Need `react-router-dom` for multi-page.
- **No auth system.** Login modal is visual only. Need real auth flow.
- **No database.** Need to decide: Firebase/Supabase (fastest) vs. custom Node/Express + DB.
- **Tailwind is CDN-loaded** via `<script>` tag in `index.html`, NOT PostCSS. This works for now but custom classes must go in the tailwind.config inside `index.html`.
- **No state management.** Only React useState. May need Context API or Zustand for auth/user state.
- **Three.js is a heavy dependency.** Only used for Hero background. Keep it isolated — don't spread it.

### What I (Copilot) CAN Do
- ✅ Generate React components (TSX + Tailwind)
- ✅ Create page layouts, forms, modals, dashboards
- ✅ Wire up react-router-dom routes
- ✅ Build mock data structures and local state logic
- ✅ Create quiz builder UI, lesson editors, kanban boards
- ✅ Implement client-side filtering, sorting, searching
- ✅ Generate TypeScript types and interfaces
- ✅ Help with Supabase/Firebase integration patterns
- ✅ Create reporting tables and chart layouts

### What I (Copilot) CANNOT Do
- ❌ Deploy to production hosting (need human for Vercel/Netlify/Firebase deploy)
- ❌ Create actual cloud database instances (need D to provision)
- ❌ Send real emails (attendee invites need backend service)
- ❌ Process real payments (Stripe/Razorpay needs backend + keys)
- ❌ Upload actual files to cloud storage (need S3/Firebase Storage config)
- ❌ Create real OAuth (Google sign-in needs console setup)

### Pragmatic Decisions for 23 Hours
| Feature | Approach | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Auth | Mock auth with Context (localStorage) OR Supabase Auth | No time for custom JWT |
| Database | Supabase (Postgres + realtime) OR Firebase Firestore | Fastest to wire up |
| File uploads | Mock with URLs / Supabase Storage | Real upload needs backend |
| Payments | Show UI, mock the flow | No time for Stripe integration |
| Email invites | Show UI, log to console | No SMTP setup in 23h |
| Video player | Embed YouTube/iframe | Don't build custom player |
| Document viewer | PDF.js embed or iframe | Keep it simple |
| Quiz scoring | Client-side calculation, persist to DB | Works fine for demo |

## 3. Full Feature Checklist (Priority Order)

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Must have for demo
- [ ] **Routing setup** — react-router-dom with layout wrappers
- [ ] **Auth context** — login/signup/logout, role-based (Admin, Instructor, Learner)
- [ ] **Learner: Course browsing page** (B1/B2) — grid of published courses with search
- [ ] **Learner: Course detail page** (B3) — overview, progress bar, lesson list
- [ ] **Learner: Full-screen lesson player** (B5) — sidebar + video/doc/image viewer
- [ ] **Instructor: Course dashboard** (A1) — list/kanban view of courses
- [ ] **Instructor: Course form** (A2) — edit course details, publish toggle
- [ ] **Instructor: Lesson management** (A3/A4) — add/edit/delete lessons
- [ ] **Database schema + seed data** (D's job)

### 🟡 IMPORTANT — Makes demo convincing
- [ ] **Learner: Quiz flow** (B6) — one question per page, submit, score
- [ ] **Instructor: Quiz builder** (A7) — add questions, set rewards
- [ ] **Points & Badges** (B7/B2) — earn points from quizzes, badge levels display
- [ ] **Course progress tracking** — lesson completion status, % bar
- [ ] **Ratings & Reviews** (B4) — star rating + review text
- [ ] **Instructor: Reporting dashboard** (A8) — overview cards + user table
- [ ] **Course visibility/access rules** (A5) — Everyone/SignedIn, Open/Invite/Paid

### 🟢 NICE TO HAVE — If time allows
- [ ] **Kanban view** for instructor dashboard (vs just list)
- [ ] **Customizable columns** in reporting table
- [ ] **Share course link** generation
- [ ] **Contact attendees** wizard
- [ ] **Additional attachments** on lessons
- [ ] **Course completion certificate/popup**
- [ ] **Dark mode** across ALL new pages (already works on landing)
- [ ] **Mobile responsive** polish on all new pages
- [ ] **Chatbot / AI feature** (J's optional task)

/admin/courses/new         → Create course
/admin/courses/:id         → Course form/editor (A2)
/admin/courses/:id/content → Lesson management (A3)
/admin/courses/:id/quiz    → Quiz management (A6)

## 7. Next Steps (In Order)

1. **Create `.gitignore` and make initial commit** ← doing now
2. **Install `react-router-dom`** and set up routing in App.tsx
3. **Create page shell components** (empty pages with basic layout)
4. **Create AuthContext** with mock login (localStorage)
5. **Build Learner flow first** (most visible for demo):
   - Course listing → Course detail → Lesson player
6. **Build Instructor flow** (backoffice):
   - Dashboard → Course form → Lesson editor → Quiz builder
7. **Wire up to real backend** when D has APIs ready
8. **Add polish**: progress tracking, points, badges, reviews
9. **Final integration + bug fixes** in last 3-4 hours
